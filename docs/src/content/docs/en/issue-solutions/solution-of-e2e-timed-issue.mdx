title: Solution of e2e timed issue
description: Solution of e2e timed issue
---

**Issue**

When running the e2e tests, all e2e tests failed because we can't get build data from BuildKite.

**Reason**

![BuildKite Expired](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/au-heartbeat/data-hosting@main/issue-solution/buildkite-expired.png)

- for `free user` on BuildKite, BuildKite will save pipeline build data only for 90 days. So after 90 days of the time selected in e2e test, we will not get build data from BuildKite.

**Solution**

- Modify e2e test regularly

**Estimated the time of next modification**

- the time we select mainly is from `2024-06-03` to `2024-06-07` in the e2e test, so according to my personal estimate that next modified time should be around `2024-09-01`.
- From `2024-09-01` to `2024-09-05`, the steps are obtained but the result will be changed, because the e2e test can get only partial build data.
- After `2024-09-05`, the e2e test can't get any build data from the `2024-06-03` to `2024-06-07` time range.

> Tips: The estimated time may not be completely accurate

**Summary steps**

> Tips: The following steps are based on our experience and are not required to be followed. If there is any more excellent experience, you can modify the following steps.

	    <td rowspan="8">Step 2. Modify the e2e test</td>

Tips: there is an e2e test to test the pipeline that is no organization in the unhappy path, and the placeholder is <code>&lt;E2E_TOKEN_PIPELINE_NO_ORG_CONFIG_BUILDKITE&gt;</code>, maybe you need to check if the token is correct</td>

	    <td>6. If the download csv files are not equal to local csv files, change the local csv files to download files</td>

For board csv file, the current jira cards will be added after the blank line in the file, but at different times, these cards are not same, so when we parse the local csv file and download csv file, we set the number of the lines that need to be parsed, so the value that is usually equal to 1 + the number of non-done cards in the <code>BOARD_CSV_COMPARED_LINES</code> of <code>create-new/report-result.ts</code> file may be modified</td>
	</tr>
  <tr>
	    <td>7. Repeat Step 1 and Step 2, until all e2e tests are passed in the local</td>
	    <td>Tips: For special tests, we need to prepare special time periods. For example, in the unhappy path when import file, we will test the function that board configuration don't exist in the metrics page, so the board data should not exist in the time periods that we select, and the time periods usually are holiday, such as from 2024-05-01 to 2024-05-05</td>
