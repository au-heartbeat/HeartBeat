title: Sharing Report
description: Design to share the report to anyone
---

## Background

It is a bit difficult to get the final report for some users, they just want to see the report, do not want to store/upload the config file for our app. it is reasonable for the product.

Our target is to re-design the arch to match the user's requirement.

backend --> frontend: uuid
loop Sprint list
  frontend -> backend: POST /reports/:uuid with the previous/same payload
