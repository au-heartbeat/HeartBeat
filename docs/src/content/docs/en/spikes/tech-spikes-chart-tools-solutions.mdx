According to the new business requirements and the roadmap, there is a need to introduce a general-purpose chart library to support corresponding development needs. Based on business requirements, there are several requirements for charts:
* Responsive support
* Support for multiple y-axes and composite charts
* Support for custom tooltips
* Support for filtering charts through legends
