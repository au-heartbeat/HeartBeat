title: Spike Chart Tool
description: Seeking Suitable Chart Components for Heartbeat
---


## Background
In order to meet new business requirements and future feature iterations, there is a need to find charting tools that align with the business needs.

## Expectations
1. Identifying suitable charting tools.
2. Supporting responsive design.
3. Ability to filter through legends.
4. Customizable tooltips.
5. Incorporating multiple y-axes and mixed charts.

## Solution
The decision is to utilize Recharts as the charting tool for Heartbeat.

### 1. Decision Rationale
Recharts offers several advantages:
   - It satisfies both current and foreseeable business requirements.
   - It stands out as one of the most React-friendly charting libraries.
   - The documentation is comprehensive, with easy-to-understand content (including Chinese translations).
   - It boasts an active community and provides extensive examples.
   - Configuration is straightforward, and declaring chart structures using JSX tags enhances readability.

### 2. Comparison with Other Solutions
   Nivo:
      Nivo's configuration is more complex compared to Recharts, with a steeper learning curve and less compatibility with React.
   Victory:
      Victory requires completely manual chart construction, resulting in high implementation costs.
   React-vis:
      React-vis offers relatively fewer charting options compared to Recharts.
