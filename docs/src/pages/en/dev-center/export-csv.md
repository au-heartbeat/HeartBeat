## Impact w/o metrics set up

- On the config page, selecting `Lead times for changes`, `Deployment frequency`, `Change failure rate`, or `Mean
time to recovery` will display the `export pipeline data` button.
- Only selecting `Lead times for changes`, can get value of `Committer`,`Code Committed Time` and
  completed `leadTimeInfo`.
- On the metrics page, selecting different pipeline and step will show different data.
